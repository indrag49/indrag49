- I am a Masters student from the department of Physics, at Jadavpur University, with a specialization in Condensed Matter Physics. My interests lie in Computational Physics, Open Source Software Projects, Lattice Theory, Game Theory, lambda calculus and Quantum Computing. I write codes in R, Python, Fortran and sometimes Julia. I am the developer and the maintainer of the [QGameTheory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QGameTheory/index.html) package written in R. I have presented in multiple national and international conferences like SLAS, SciPy India, e-Rum, IC2DN, etc. 

```bash
- Lead of computational physics app development and simulations group at the Sirpi Data Science team.
- Side project that I am working on is related to [Computational Photonics](https://indrag49.github.io/project1.html) simulations.
- Would like to collaborate on topics related to R package developments, shiny app developments, numerical methods, dynamical systems and quantum computing.
- Currently trying to learn financial analysis from "Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering" by Ruppert and Matteson.
