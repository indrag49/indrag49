I am a Postdoctoral fellow in Applied Mathematics, working on dynamical systems, at the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences (SMCS), Massey University. Before joining as a Ph.D. student, I worked as a research lead and the lead of spatial wind software project called SHEAR whose purpose was to extrapolate wind data based on given anemometer heights, at Sirpi Products and Services Pvt. Ltd. Before that, I was a Masters student in the department of Physics, Jadavpur University. My specialization was in Condensed Matter Physics. My interests lie in Nonlinear dynamics, Computational Physics, Open Source Scientific Software, Game Theory, and Quantum Computing.
