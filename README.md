- I am a Masters student from the department of Physics, at Jadavpur University, with a specialization in Condensed Matter Physics. My interests lie in Computational Physics, Open Source Software Projects, Lattice Theory, Game Theory, lambda calculus and Quantum Computing. I write codes in R, Python, Fortran and sometimes Julia. I am the developer and the maintainer of the [QGameTheory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QGameTheory/index.html) package written in R. I am currently learning **Computational Photonics**. I have presented in multiple national and international conferences like SLAS, SciPy India, e-Rum, IC2DN, etc. 

- I will like to collaborate on topics related to R package developments, numerical methods, dynamical systems and quantum computing.
